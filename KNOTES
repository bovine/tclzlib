This is a Tcl interface to zlib that I found on the net.  I think it might
hae been stripped out of the Tcl virtual file system (tclvfs).

CONIGURE
--------

Configure it like this:

./configure --with-tcl=/usr/local/lib/tcl8.4 --with-tclinclude=/usr/local/include/tcl8.4

USE
---

To use:

	package require zlib

	zlib subcommand ?data?

It adds a new command, zlib.

zlib has arguments.  The first argument can be one of:

	adler32

	crc32 - compute a checksum

	compress - one way to compress stuff

	deflate - the other way to compress stuff

	decompress - one way to decompress stuff

	inflate - the other way to decompress stuff

	sdecompress

	sinflate



The FAA ASDI XML feed's compressed data can be decompressed with:

	set decompPayload [zlib decompress $payload]



The sdecompress and sinflate subcommands are, I think, file-oriented.

It works with zlib, the home page of which is http://www.zlib.net.

This is the same zlib that's known on FreeBSD as libz.

TODO
----

The TEA version is pretty old.  It could stand to be updated.  Or see
if tclvfs isn't the same thing and start using that instead.
